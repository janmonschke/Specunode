Specunode - a micro webframework / boilerplate
==============================================

Works great for classic websites as well as for single page apps. Also is great on hot toast :P
It's not a webframework in the sense or Rails or Django. Basically it's a combination of modules that worked well together for me in some node.js projects before and I finally wanted to have a biolerplate repo that I could use everytime I start a new project so that I won't have to start from scratch each time.

# Features

# Specunode - the name
This little piece of software has been developed while consuming unhealthy amounts of Speculoos pasta :P
Hence, the name :)
